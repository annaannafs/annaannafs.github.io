I'm a postdoctoral fellow with the [Neutrino Network Fellowship](https://ntn.fnal.gov/) at the [Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics, New York University](https://cosmo.nyu.edu/), working with Prof. [Glennys Farrar](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1010333).


My research is mainly focused on investigating the role of astrophysical neutrinos inside various stars, constraining astrophysical parameters, and discovering new physics with the neutrino signal from those sources.


Previously, I was a fellow with the [Network for Neutrinos, Nuclear Astrophysics and Symmetries (N3AS) Physics Frontier Center](https://n3as.berkeley.edu/) based at UC Berkeley. Within that fellowship, I spent 2 years at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, with [Prof. Baha Balantekin](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1017575), and 1 year at the University of California, San Diego, working with [Prof. George Fuller](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1009206).
I completed my PhD at the [Niels Bohr Institute](https://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/) of the University of Copenhagen in the fall of 2021, working on neutrino astrophysics with [Prof. Irene Tamborra](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1058384). I got my master's degree in Physics at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/) in July 2018. My thesis was focused on the diffuse supernova neutrino background.
In 2016, I obtained an engineering degree in Technical Physics at the [AGH University of Science and Technology](https://www.agh.edu.pl/en/) in Krakow. You can find more information in my [CV](https://annaannafs.github.io/files/CV-Anna-Suliga.pdf).
