Iâ€™m a postdoctoral fellow with the [Network for Neutrinos, Nuclear Astrophysics and Symmetries (N3AS) Physics Frontier Center](https://n3as.berkeley.edu/), based at UC Berkeley. I'm currently stationed at the University of California, San Diego working with [prof. George Fuller](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1009206) doing a second stage of my fellowsip after spending 1.5 years at the University of Wisconsin, Madiosn with [prof. Baha Balantekin](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1017575). My research is focused on investigating the role of neutrinos in stars and constraining astrophysical parameters and new physics with the neutrino signal from those sources.
In the fall 2024 I'll be taking the [Neutrino Network Fellowship](https://ntn.fnal.gov/) to the New York University to work with prof. [Glennys Farrar](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1010333).

I completed my PhD at the [Niels Bohr Institute](https://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/) of the University of Copenhagen in fall 2021, working on neutrino astrophysics.
I got my master's degree in Physics at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/) in July 2018. My thesis was focused on the diffuse supernova neutrino background.
In 2016, I obtained an engineering degree in Technical Physics at the [AGH University of Science and Technology](https://www.agh.edu.pl/en/) in Krakow. More information can be found in my [CV](https://annaannafs.github.io/files/CV_Anna_Suliga.pdf).
