Iâ€™m a postdoctoral fellow with the [Network for Neutrinos, Nuclear Astrophysics and Symmetries (N3AS) Physics Frontier Center](https://n3as.berkeley.edu/), based at UC Berkeley. I'm currently based at the University of Madison, working with [prof. Baha Balantekin](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1017575). My research is focused on investigating the role of neutrinos in stars and constraining astrophysical parameters and new physics with the neutrino signal from those sources.

I completed my PhD at the [Niels Bohr Institute](https://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/) of the University of Copenhagen in fall 2021, working on neutrino astrophysics.
I got my master's degree in Physics at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/) in July 2018. My thesis was focused on the diffuse supernova neutrino background.
In 2016, I obtained an engineering degree in Technical Physics at the [AGH University of Science and Technology](https://www.agh.edu.pl/en/) in Krakow. More information can be found in my [CV](https://annaannafs.github.io/files/CV_Anna_Suliga.pdf).
