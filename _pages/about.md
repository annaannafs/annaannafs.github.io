Iâ€™m a PhD student at the [Niels Bohr Institute](https://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/) of the University of Copenhagen working on neutrino astrophysics. My research is currently focused on investigating the role of neutrinos in core-collapse supernovae and constraining astrophysical parameters and new physics with the neutrino signal from those sources.

I completed my master's degree in Physics at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/) in July 2018. My thesis was focused on the diffuse supernova neutrino background.
In 2016, I obtained an engineering degree in Technical Physics at the [AGH University of Science and Technolgy](https://www.agh.edu.pl/en/) in Krakow. More information can be found in my [CV](https://annaannafs.github.io/cv/).
